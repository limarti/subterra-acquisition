# Privacy Policy
_Last updated: [Month Day, Year]_

This Privacy Policy describes how **PLACEHOLDER** (“we,” “our,” or “us”) collects, uses, and protects information in the **GLA** mobile application (“App”).
The App functions as an interface for a ground penetrating radar (GPR) device, allowing users to control the hardware and record collected data.

  We value your privacy and are committed to handling your information responsibly and transparently.

## 1. Information We Collect

The App collects only the information necessary to operate the GPR device and record data. Specifically:

- **Sensor Data:** The App collects images and GPS information from the connected GPR hardware.
- **Location Data:** The App may access your device’s GPS location to record where data is collected.
- **Third-Party Data:** The App may use a satellite image provider to display reference images within the application.

  The App does **not** collect:
- Personal information such as names, emails, or contact details
- Device identifiers (IMEI, advertising ID, etc.)
- Analytics, advertising, or crash-reporting data

---

## 2. Data Storage

All collected data (including images and GPS information) is stored **locally on your device**.
We do not upload, store, or transmit your data to our servers or to any third party.

---

## 3. Data Sharing

We do **not share** your information with third parties.
  The only exception is the optional use of **satellite image providers** to display imagery for reference within the App; no user data is transmitted to these providers.

---

## 4. Data Retention and Deletion

Data collected by the App remains on your device until you choose to delete it.
  You may remove data manually at any time by deleting recordings or uninstalling the App.

---

## 5. User Rights

Because all data remains on your device, you retain full control over your information.
  You can delete it at any time without our involvement.

---

## 6. International Use

This App is available for use globally.
  We aim to comply with major privacy principles, including those under the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** and **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**, where applicable.

  If you are located in a region with specific privacy rights, you retain the right to control, access, or delete your data as permitted by local laws.

---

## 7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect new features or changes in our practices.
  Updated versions will be made available within the App and/or on our website, with the “Last Updated” date revised accordingly.
